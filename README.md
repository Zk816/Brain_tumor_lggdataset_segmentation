Brain MRI Segmentation Project
This project performs brain tumor segmentation using deep learning models such as UNet and DeepLabV3+. The goal is to identify and segment brain tumors in MRI images.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Lower-Grade Glioma (LGG) Segmentation Dataset, which can be downloaded from Kaggle:

How to Run
Step 1: Download the Dataset
Visit the Kaggle link provided above.
Download the dataset .
Step 2: Run the Jupyter Notebook
Execute the notebook cells to train and evaluate the models.
Step 3: Run the Streamlit App
Navigate to the folder where app.py is located.
Open a terminal or Command Prompt.
Change the directory to the app folder by running:
cd path to app.py
Type: streamlit run app.py
Open the Streamlit app in your browser to test brain tumor segmentation on MRI images.
